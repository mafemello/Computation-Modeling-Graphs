Working with graphs :)

  <h2> Adjacency Matrix </h2>
  <p> Adjacency matrix is a square matrix used to represent a finite graph. The elements of the matrix indicate whether pairs of vertices are adjacent or not in the graph. <br>
    Memory (storage) cost = O(nÂ²). <br>
    Searching cost = O(1). Constant. <br> 
    It means that it is a useful representation for dense graphs with many edges and good for searching. <br>
    
  <h2> Adjacency List </h2>
   Adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a vertex in the graph. In non-directed graphs, each edge is represented twice. <br>
    Memory (storage) cost = O(n + m). Linear. <br>
    Searching cost = O(di). di = vertex degree. <br>
    It means it is a good representation for sparse graphs. The downside is the searching time to determine whether a particular edge exists or not. <br>
    
  <h2> Fleury's Algorithm </h2>
   Eulerian Path is a path in graph that visits every edge exactly once. Eulerian Circuit is an Eulerian Path which starts and ends on the same vertex. Fleury's algorithm aims to find a Eulerian Circuit in a graph. <br>
